    <h2>The Value of Money</h2>
    <p>The U.S. Dollar Measures the Value of Money in America In the United States, the U.S. dollar determines the value of money. There are three ways to measure the value of the dollar. The first is how much the dollar will buy in foreign currencies. The exchange rate measures that value. Forex traders on the foreign exchange market determine that value. They take into account current supply and demand, as well as their expectations for the future. For this reason, the value of money fluctuates throughout the trading day. The second method is the value of Treasury notes. They can be converted easily into dollars through the secondary market for Treasuries. When the demand for Treasuries is high, the value of all money in America rises. <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/value-of-money-3306108">Source</a></p>

    <h2>GMO Food</h2>
    <p>It’s a growing controversy: Should GMO foods always be labeled so consumers are aware that the product contains genetically modified ingredients? GMOs—or genetically modified organisms—are created in a lab by altering the genetic makeup of a plant or an animal. Ninety-two percent of Americans believe that GMO foods—widely found in kitchens across the country—should be labeled before they’re sold, according to a recent nationally representative survey of 1,004 people from the Consumer Reports National Research Center. (Last year our tests discovered that GMOs were present in many packaged foods, such as breakfast cereals, chips, baking mixes, and protein bars.) <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/02/gmo-foods-what-you-need-to-know/index.htm">Source</a></p>

    <h2>The World in 2100</h2>
    <p>The world is expected to add another billion people within the next 15 years, bringing the total global population from 7.3 billion in mid-2015 to 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion by 2100, according to new estimates from the UN. Currently, 60 percent of the global population lives in Asia, 16 percent in Africa, 10 percent in Europe, 9 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and only 5 percent in North America and Oceania. China and India are the largest countries in the world, together making up almost 40 percent of the world population. But those numbers won’t stay that way for long. The charts below, created by data scientist Tariq Khokhar for the World Bank data blog using the medium estimates of the UN figures, show our world is set to change in surprising ways. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/17/5-ways-the-world-will-look-dramatically-different-in-2100/?utm_term=.6322b71abe8b">Source</a></p>
